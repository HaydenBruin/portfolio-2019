<h2>Building a safer online dating experience one tap at a time.</h2>
<h3>At a Glance</h3>
<p>From branding to build, we developed a <strong>bespoke mobile-first dating site</strong> built around member profile validation to provide an alternative dating option for London's gay community.</p>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>While online dating has many plus points, perhaps its biggest challenge is engendering trust. People want to be assured that the person they are communicating with is genuine.</p><p>The goal therefore for our clients was to create a dating site that could establish itself alongside the heavy hitters of the industry, while keeping member safety at its core.</p>
<p>We had to ensure that the site encouraged members to validate their identity before contacting others and that doing so was as straightforward as possible.</p>
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>After conducting <strong>research</strong> into potential markets in which to launch the site first, the London gay community stood out as a segment looking for a more secure, trusted dating experience.</p>
<p>Beginning at the <strong>branding</strong> stage, our brief was to portray a more refined image for Future Blossom than its competitors, one that would reflect the concept of creating lasting relationships.</p>
<p>Adopting a gold palette with plenty of white-space gives the site a feeling of class and maturity, while a logo incorporating hearts arranged in a flower pattern subtly&nbsp;references the blossoming of relationships.</p>
<p>From a development perspective, responding to the popularity and prevalence of mobile dating apps, we adopted a <strong>mobile-first approach</strong> to the design, making use of the familiar swipe gesture to allow members to browse between profiles.</p>
<p><img src='/media/future_blossom_mobile_screen.jpg' alt='Future Blossom - mobile view' style='display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'></p><p>Our development of a bespoke <strong>user onboarding</strong> process reduces the barrier to sign up and captures member information in a less intrusive and tedious way to other websites.</p>
<p>An intuitive profile search engine and <strong>an in-app payment system</strong> where members can buy credits via PayPal allows members to find and chat with other users in just a few swipes and taps.</p><p>Building on our initial research, we took Future Blossom to market via a series of targeted <strong>Google Adwords</strong> and <strong>email marketing</strong> campaigns.</p>
<p>The end result is an elegant and easy-to-use new breed of online dating site, which our clients and we hope will help people build genuine lasting relationships.</p>
